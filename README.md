# Playlist-Maker
The archive should be extracted for correct functionality!

OOP project made in C++ with QT for the graphic user interface. The user has the option to add/update/remove songs which are saved/loaded in/from a text file (CSV) by overloading the operators "<<" and ">>".He can search for a song ( by typing in a qLineEdit - the list is changed with each modification) and also give a like to a song. If a song is seleted with the mouse from the list, it's information will appear in some qlineEdits.

Also the user can add/remove a song to/from the playlist.The songs from the playlist can be selected with the mouse, and can be opened in the browser. (There are also function fro nextSong and previousSong - which open in the browser the next/previous song) -the selected songs are highlighted.

The songs from the playlist are stored in a html file, which can be opened from the user in the browser ( formated in a table).
